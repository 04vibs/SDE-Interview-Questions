- There are N trees in a circle. Each tree has a fruit value associated with it. A bird has to sit on a tree for 0.5 sec to gather all the fruits present on the tree and then the   bird can move to a neighboring tree. It takes the bird 0.5 seconds to move from one tree to another. Once all the fruits are picked from a particular tree, she can’t pick any     more fruits from that tree. The maximum number of fruits she can gather is infinite.
  Given N and M (the total number of seconds the bird has), and the fruit values of the trees. We have to maximize the total fruit value that the bird can gather. The bird can       start from any tree.<br>
  
- Given two numbers as stings s1 and s2 your task is to multiply them.<br>

- Find the longest increasing subsequence of a given array of integers, A.
  In other words, find a subsequence of array in which the subsequence’s elements are in strictly increasing order, and in which the subsequence is as long as possible.
  This subsequence is not necessarily contiguous, or unique.
  In this case, we only care about the length of the longest increasing subsequence.<br>
    Sample Input:  A = 1,2,1,5
    Sample Output: 3<br>
  

- A message containing letters from A-Z is being encoded to numbers using the following mapping:
  'A' -> 1
  'B' -> 2
   ...
  'Z' -> 26
  Given an encoded message A containing digits, determine the total number of ways to decode it modulo 10^9+7.<br>
